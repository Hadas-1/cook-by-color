# cook-by-color
A design project using Processing.org: cook a recipe through color reference. Compare your cooking to the desired recipe, step by step.
Use a camera to take snapshots of the food: aim the camera to the food, and click the Sketch on the screen. I used EpocCam free app. It turns your mobile phone into a webcam. Download here: http://www.kinoni.com
Toggle between different steps of the recipe by clicking on the numbers on the keyboard. I uploaded in advance the desired photos to the data folder and named them 1.jpg, 2.jpg. etc.

This is my first attempt using Processing.org. Please let me know if you have any comments.
